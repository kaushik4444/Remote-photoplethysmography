# rPPG
Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a contactless method to monitor human cardiac activities by detecting the pulse-induced subtle color variations on human skin surface using a multi-wavelength RGB camera. By measuring the variance of red, green, and blue light reflection changes from the skin, as the contrast between specular reflection and diffused reflection.
